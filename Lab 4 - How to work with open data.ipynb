    "# Lab 4 - How to work with open data\n",
    "*Â© 2020 Colin Conrad*\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 4 of INFO 6270! Last week we covered basic data cleaning and analysis using lists and dictionaries. This week we are making our way to our final lesson on basic Python: libraries and external files. This week we will do a few things that will more relatable (and useful!) to most of you. We will start by learning how to navigate files in our Python environment before making our way to work with CSV and PDF files. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week's work covers a **lot** of ground from [Sweigart (2020)](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). Instead of going through these chapters in depth, we will borrow some of the material from Chapters 15 and 16 throughout and apply it in a way that is more relevant to our context. If you are interested (and have the time) it is also helpful to have read Chapters 6 and 7 on string manipulation and regular expressions. The later is quite complex however and we will not cover it in this course; if you want to be a data science expert though, you should definitely learn regular expressions!\n",
    "\n",
    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Locate files using Python\n",
    "- Retrieve CSV data\n",
    "- Analyze and write CSV data\n",
    "- Retrieve and analyze PDF data\n",
    "- Write PDF files\n",

    "# Case: The 2016 Canadian Census\n",
    "The Canadian Census Program is a data collection program conducted by Statistics Canada every five years and has occurred regularly since 1851, before confederation. Census records are maintained by two federal government agencies based on their date of record. Census records prior to 1926 are curated by [Library and Archives Canada](https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/census/Pages/census.aspx), while records after 1926 are maintained by [Statistics Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm). These records represent the most comprehensive data on the Canadian population and are (for the most part) publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to census profiles on various regions throughout the country, the Census Program provides [detailed data tables](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/index-eng.cfm) on a variety of topics. Housing is one such topic and the data table titled [\"Tenure including presence of mortgage payments and subsidized housing\"](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&A=R&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=01&GL=-1&GID=1341679&GK=1&GRP=1&O=D&PID=110574&PRID=10&PTYPE=109445&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2017&THEME=121&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0) is particularly relevant to understanding housing affordability among Canadians because it provides the number of Canadian households which reported unaffordable housing or whether their households were in need of repairs. In this last lab in a series related to housing security, we will retrieve and analyze the tables provided by the census to generate insights about housing needs in Canada and Halifax specifically, if so desired."

As mentioned in class, one of the main advantages of Python versus other programming languages is that it is *high level and highly portable*. This is to say that you can do a lot with Python in a few lines of code. One of the main things that makes this possible are Python's libraries.\n",

These greatly accelerate the time that it takes to finish a programming task, and in some cases, save you years of work. Just like libraries designed for humans, Python programming libraries are generally curated by groups of people who ensure that the library is usable. As a free and open source programming language, experienced developers will often create and curate libraries for free, sometimes at great expense of their time!\n",

Look for a tool called the **Anaconda Prompt** which should have been installed on your computer when you installed Anaconda.

This comes with the advantage that we do not need to be administrators in order to install new stuff.\n",

Frustratingly, organizations will occasionally post data tables in this format, which makes it difficult to employ analytical tools such as Excel or Tableau.
